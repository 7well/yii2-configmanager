A simple parameter/configuration manager. This module can manage your configuration stored in a database. Each parameter can load at bootstrap if necessary or is available during the component in the application.

The current version is a development snapshot, do not use in production application!


> **NOTE:** Module is in initial development. Anything may change at any time.

## Roadmap
-   Improve UI (drop down list for parent config, flash messages, etc.)
-	Tests
-	Documentation
-	Detailed configuration possibility e.g. component database hat two an more property, currently you must set this by a php array string. In future it should be possible to generate this array during singly parameter and the config manager should gernerate one array.
